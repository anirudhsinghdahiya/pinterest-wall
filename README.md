# Pinterest Wall

A dreamy, floating image wall that brings your Pinterest boards to life with smooth animations and premium aesthetics.

## Current Status

**Work in Progress - Aesthetic Test Phase**

This project is currently in development and serves as an aesthetic proof-of-concept. The current implementation uses demo Unsplash images while awaiting Pinterest Developer API approval.

## Project Vision

The goal is to create an immersive, living mood board that:
- Continuously displays images from your curated Pinterest boards
- Creates a calming, atmospheric visual experience
- Serves as ambient art for your workspace or living space
- Transforms static Pinterest collections into dynamic, flowing displays

Think of it as a digital lava lamp, but with your carefully curated aesthetic instead of blobs.

## Current Features

### Premium Aesthetic
- **Atmospheric Background**: Animated gradient that slowly shifts between deep purples and blues
- **Smooth Animations**: Images float gracefully across the screen (45-70 second duration)
- **Visual Depth**: Layered shadows, subtle glow effects, and backdrop blur
- **Elegant Interactions**: Smooth opacity and scale transitions on hover

### Technical Implementation
- Built with **Next.js 14** and **React**
- Animations powered by **Framer Motion**
- Responsive design with **Tailwind CSS**
- TypeScript for type safety
- 580 lines of clean, maintainable code

### Animation System
- Continuous horizontal movement with seamless looping
- Full screen coverage (images positioned from -10% to 110% viewport height)
- Randomized positioning, rotation, and timing for organic feel
- Size variation (180-380px) for visual interest
- No jerky resets - smooth `repeatType: 'loop'` implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anirudhsinghdahiya/pinterest-wall.git

## Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes **aesthetic excellence** over minimalism. The goal is to create something that:
- Feels premium and polished from first glance
- Uses modern web design patterns (gradients, glassmorphism, micro-animations)
- Creates an emotional response - calm, dreamy, inspiring
- Demonstrates technical skill while maintaining code quality

## Future Ideas

- **Multi-monitor support**: Span the wall across multiple displays
- **Music integration**: Sync animation speed with ambient music
- **Time-based themes**: Different aesthetics for morning/evening
- **Social features**: Share your wall configuration with others
- **Screensaver mode**: Full-screen mode with no UI elements

## Notes

- Currently using Unsplash demo images (116 images across various themes)
- Pinterest Developer API application pending approval
- Optimized for desktop viewing (mobile support coming in Phase 4)
- All animations use hardware acceleration for smooth performance
